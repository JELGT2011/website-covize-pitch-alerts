## API

This app uses a standard REST architecture, but has a separate scope for three reasons:

* to allow calls without admin authentication
* to allow for slightly different filtering capabilities
* to default all requests to not include passed events

With that, the base url will be `covize-pitch-alerts.herokuapp.com/api/`

So an example GET request might look like this: `covize-pitch-alerts.herokuapp.com/api/pitch_events`

which would return a listing of all pitch events in JSON format.

For now, everything is passed in as a url parameter.  Here is a listing:
